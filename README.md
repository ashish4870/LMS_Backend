# Test Update Endpoint

## Overview

This API endpoint updates a test with a new question and provides the next question based on the current state of the test. It adjusts the difficulty level of subsequent questions based on the userâ€™s responses and ensures that no previously asked questions are repeated.

## Endpoint

### Update Test

**POST** `/tests/:testId/update`

#### URL Parameters

- `testId` (string): The ID of the test to be updated.

#### Request Body

- `questionId` (string): The ID of the question to be added to the test.
- `answer` (string): The user's answer to the question.
- `score` (number): The score given for the question.
- `difficulty` (number): The difficulty level of the question.

#### Response

- **Success (200 OK)**
  - Returns the next question and the total score if the test is not completed.
  - If the test has 5 or more questions, marks it as completed and returns the total score.

- **Error (404 Not Found)**
  - If the question or test is not found.
  - If no available questions exist for the next difficulty level.

- **Error (400 Bad Request)**
  - If there is a failure in updating the test.

## Algorithm for Selecting the Next Question

1. **Retrieve Current Question:**
   - Fetch the question specified by `questionId` from the `Question` collection in the database.
   - If the question is not found, return a 404 error.

2. **Update Test with New Question:**
   - Fetch the test specified by `testId` from the `Test` collection in the database.
   - If the test is not found, return a 404 error.
   - Add the current question to the test's list of questions with the provided `answer`, `score`, and `difficulty`.
   - Update the test's total score by summing the scores of all questions in the test.

3. **Determine Next Difficulty Level:**
   - Adjust the difficulty level for the next question based on the current `difficulty` and `score`.
     - If the score is positive (`score > 0`), increase the difficulty level.
     - If the score is zero or negative (`score <= 0`), decrease the difficulty level.

4. **Filter Available Questions:**
   - Query the `Question` collection for questions that match the newly determined difficulty level.
   - Create a set of questions that have already been asked in the current test.
   - Filter out questions that have already been asked from the available questions.

5. **Select the Next Question:**
   - If there are no available questions for the next difficulty level, return a 404 error.
   - Randomly select a question from the filtered list of available questions.
   - If no question is found, return a 404 error.

6. **Complete the Test Check:**
   - Check if the test now contains 5 or more questions.
   - If so, mark the test as completed and return a completion message along with the total score.
   - Otherwise, return the next question and the total score.
